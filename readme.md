Snake Game 🎮🐍
Description

This is a modern and visually appealing Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The player controls a snake that moves around the board, eating apples to grow longer.
The game gets faster and more challenging as you score points.

Special twist:

At the start, the snake eats 1 apple at a time.

After eating 2 apples, two apples will spawn at once for more fun and chaos.

The game speed increases every 5 points, making it harder to survive.
